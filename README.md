# lab-animations
Each R script builds a function and metadata file that can produce x and y coordinates to animate any desired combination of dot approach angle, size, direction, and speed (condition). Valence sweep moves dots across the arena through a point in front of the fish; loom moves dots toward the head of the fish; translate moves dots around the fish. The meta tsv files put numbers to each condition. Filter and play!
